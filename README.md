> Utility to inspect/modify DataMover DAT files

DMS Viewer allows you to view and/or modify existing DAT files generated by PeopleSoft's DataMover utility.

There are experimental features that allow you to modify DAT files such as:
* Editing values
* Add/Remove Columns
* Add/Remove Rows
* Adjust Record Metadata

## Installation
